        <h2>First Blog Post</h2>
        <p class="quote">What makes a great travel blog? Well, it’s going to be subjective. Everyone will have their own
            opinions. And that’s ok.

            Personally, my favorite blogs about travel blend a difficult-to-achieve combination of good writing, great
            photography, helpful advice, and smart webdesign. They might not all be the most popular blogs, but they get
            me excited to discover and learn about new places.

            So in no particular order, below you’ll find my favorite travel blogs for 2020. Follow them if you’d like to
            escape from reality for a while during your work break — and maybe get inspired for your next trip in the
            process!</p>

        <h2>Second Blog Post</h2>
        <p class="quote">By road, by kayak, by seaplane and most of all on foot, Erik Gauger tackles the themes of city
            and country in the modern world on his blog Notes From The Road. Erik shares “the messy truth of travel,
            told by a regular guy.” His photography and writing are some of the best I’ve seen online from an
            independent travel blog. You’ll get lost for hours reading his stories.</p>
        <p>Originally from the United States, Daniel Noll and Audrey Scott are the husband-and-wife storytelling team
            behind Uncornered Market. Through their stories, and speaking about sustainable tourism, they are creating a
            movement of travelers who live at the intersection of adventure, deep travel and life experiences. More than
            90 countries later, they are still going… and still married.

        <p>If you want to see one of the most beautiful cities on the Adriatic, you should travel to Rovinj, Croatia.
            Rovinj (pronounced ro-VEEN) is a surprise to most people who visit it. Sure, this is technically Croatia —
            but Rovinj looks like it could be in Italy! Almost like an extension of Venice! And while …</p>
